# Stoicism

I started the morning off by listening to the Tim Ferriss podcast; today's episode was featuring his [TED Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/tim_ferriss_why_you_should_define_your_fears_instead_of_your_goals?language=en#t-364973) on defining fears rather than goals. This practice helps you thrive in your personal and professional life. By defining your fears, you are able to methotically awknowledge them, address worst case scenarios and then how you'd handle the worst case scenario. Most of us, myself very much included, life in a way where we think about everything that could go wrong. We get stuck in this endless mental hampster wheel of "what ifs." 

In listing them out, we are able to move past that phase of mental thinking. The final piece of defining your fears is listing out all the things that will not happen if your fears are holding you back from something. For example, if you are afriad to travel somewhere new -- you could be fearful you won't have a good time, or you'll be missing something at work. But, if you let fears hold you back and don't go -- you could risk missing out on the trip of a lifetime. 

- DEFINE - List 10 fears
- PREVENT - Why you fear it/what could go wrong
- REPAIR - How you could mitigate the prevent column

In this talk, Tim talks about being inspired by stoicism: the endurance of pain or hardship without the display of feelings and without complaint. 

This lead me down a rabbit hole about stoicism. Here's some resources:

In these uncertain COVID-19 times, it seems like an oportune time to start using stoicism to be better eqipped to mentally deal with uncertainty and high-stress times.
